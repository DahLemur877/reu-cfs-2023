## Exercises,

In order of difficulty,

1. [Short exercises](https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs/blob/master/reu-cfs-2023/exercises/python-grab-bag.ipynb)
The first set of programs to undertake. 
3. [Classical Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs/blob/master/reu-cfs-2023/exercises/classic-sorting-algorithms.ipynb).
The programs exercise loop invariants.
1. [Connected Graph](https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs/blob/master/reu-cfs-2023/exercises/connected_graph.ipynb).
Graph algorithm type difficulty.
1. [Slice programming]([https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs/blob/master/reu-cfs-2023/exercises/connected_graph.ipynb](https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs-2023/blob/main/exercises/slice_program.ipynb)). THe largest interval sum problem, done through all pairs search with a reference to dynamic programming; and a card shuffling game.
